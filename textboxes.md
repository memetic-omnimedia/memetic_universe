Frame 2:
Ladies and Gentleman, The University put your hands together for Professor MacArthur, Head of the Center for Human Alignment, and leader of the Memetic Universe project!

Frame 3:
Good evening. I'm Dr. Amy MacArthur. I worked as an editor at the Times, then as an Public Information Officer during the war, and now I am the ranking party member in charge of the Center for Human Alignment within the Department of Memetics.

The Center for Human Alignment was founded as part of the War on Hate initiative. We run the Memetic Universe project - our attempt to create a noosphere free of hate-inducing memeplexes. I am thrilled to tell you all that we have made SO MUCH progress.

Frame 4:
None of this would be possible without Mindpods. I want to thank our partners at Sinotech and the Farahany institute who were instrumental in the innovations that make mindpods so amazing.

Frame 5:
Mindpods are now widely used across the population. They use EEG, fMRI, and other passive imaging techniques to read people's brains. In addition, they cross-reference brain data with the media consumption profile of individuals. What this means is we can identify exactly what media - which memes - instatiate engrams of hate in the human brain.

Frame 6:
The War on Hate has given us priveled access to the wider population's brain data and media data. All of this is fed into powerful AI models. The result is that we can not only identify all of the extant hateful memes in the population, we can also predict what memes are likely to cause hate in which individuals.

Frame 7:
Thank you so much. We have made so much progress in the War on Hate and Human Alignment. Massive thanks to the University, we couldn't have done this without you.
